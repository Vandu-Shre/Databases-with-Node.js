## Course Description

In this course, Daniel Khan—a technology lead, developer, and application architect—shows you how to manage databases from SQL and NoSQL, to in-memory databases, and learn how to work with them in real-time applications. Discover the basics and applications of SQL databases like MySQL for structured, relational data, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB for dynamic data storage. Learn how to use Redis for super-fast, in-memory data management that is perfect for session management and real-time processing. Get hands-on experience with connecting databases to Node.js applications through practical examples and projects. Understand how to write, read, update, and delete operations with these databases and incorporate them seamlessly into your web development workflow. By the end of the course, you will be capable of managing complex database operations, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing your web applications for better performance.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
